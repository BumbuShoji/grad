       "40  As a teacher, I don't need to select one of these options. But as a suggestion, you might want to consider your taste preference and dietary needs when making your selection. If you're looking for something flavorful, option 1 might be a good choice. If you're watching your sugar intake, option 3 would be best. If you're interested in the health benefits of antioxidants, option 4 would be great. And if you prefer simple and plain, option 2 is ideal.   \n",
